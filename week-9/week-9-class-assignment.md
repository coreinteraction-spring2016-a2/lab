Folder name: `week-9-class-assignment`

## Process

You can use either jQuery or raw javascript to complete the steps below -- it's up to you.

- Choose one of your haiku pages to start with. Copy it to a new folder to edit.
- Add three buttons to the page (it's up to you what they say and look like).
- Create a new script file and include it on your page. 
- Add click handlers to each of the buttons you've created.
	- One click handler should add a new element or elements to the page
	- One click handler should change the style of the page in some way
	- One click handler can do anything, but should make use of `setTimeout` or `setInterval`
