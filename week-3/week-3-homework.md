# Week 3 Homework

Folder name: `week-3-homework`

## Process

Use the position and display properties we learned in class today to create **three** abstract layouts of your own.

Each layout must include:

- An absolutely positioned element
- A relatively positioned element
- A series of inline-block elements
- A fixed element

Try to create something visually interesting. You'll probably need more elements, and maybe many more than those required above.
