# Class assignment

Folder name: `week-6-class-assignment`

## Process

* Incorporate a `select` element into your grid assignment from last week. 
* Use javascript to change your page when the value of the select element changes. 
* The change you make should be fairly substantial â€“ it might be the theme of the page, it might swap the images out for other images, or it might do something else entirely, but it should have a major effect on the experience of viewing the page.
