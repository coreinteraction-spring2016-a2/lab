# Homework

Homework must be pushed to Github before the start of class. If you miss a class, you're responsible for handing in any homework due that class, any homework assigned that class, and any in-class work before the next class. If this is really not possible for some reason, email me _before_ class and we'll work it out.

Late work gets half credit.

Work that is broken or does not fulfill the assignment also gets half credit, but you have until the end of the semester to fix it for full credit.
